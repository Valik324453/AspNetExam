				<HxCardText>We opened The BikeShop in 1998 in a 500 square-foot space on a shoestring budget in Tustin, California. Back then there was barely enough room to set up a repair stand, but over the years The Path has expanded as neighboring suites have opened up in our building.</HxCardText>
				<HxCardText>In 2009 we moved our retail store into its current location in the building next door. Today, the original shop space is used for storage, and our retail store is now approximately 5,000 square feet.</HxCardText>
				<HxCardText>In October 2012, we opened a second location in Trabuco Canyon, California. The Path Bike Shop Live Oak is located near popular Orange County trails, including the Luge. It's slightly smaller than our Tustin store, but is still well stocked and has a full-service repair department.</HxCardText>
